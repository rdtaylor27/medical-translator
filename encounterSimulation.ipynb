      "{'result': \"Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness: The patient is a 50-year-old female presenting with abdominal pain that started approximately 3 days ago. She describes the pain as a constant, dull ache located in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. The pain intensity is rated 6/10 and has gradually worsened since its onset. She has experienced associated symptoms of mild nausea and decreased appetite but denies vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. The patient notes that the pain is somewhat alleviated by lying down and worsens with movement or palpation.\\n\\nPast Medical History: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Both conditions are well-controlled with medication.\\n\\nPast Surgical History: The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 5 years ago with no complications.\\n\\nFamily History: The patient's mother had a history of breast cancer, and her father had a history of type 2 diabetes. No known family history of gastrointestinal disorders.\\n\\nCurrent Medications: The patient is currently taking Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily for hyperlipidemia.\\n\\nAllergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nSocial History: The patient is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally, approximately 1-2 drinks per week. She works as an accountant and lives with her spouse. She denies any illicit drug use.\\n\\nReview of Systems: The patient reports mild nausea and decreased appetite but denies fever, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, or hematochezia. She also denies any recent travel or dietary changes.\\n\\nPhysical Exam: On physical examination, the patient appears moderately distressed due to pain. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6°F. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness to palpation in the lower right quadrant with mild guarding but no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no evidence of abdominal distension or masses. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.\\n\\nAssessment and Plan: The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of appendicitis. I recommend an urgent abdominal ultrasound and complete blood count to evaluate for possible infection or inflammation. If the ultrasound confirms appendicitis, the patient will likely need a surgical consult for an appendectomy. In the meantime, I will prescribe Acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain relief. The patient has been instructed to return to the emergency department if the pain significantly worsens, she develops a fever, or if she experiences vomiting that she cannot manage at home.\"}\n",
